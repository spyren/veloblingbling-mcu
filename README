Firmware for the Velo Bling-Bling project
*****************************************

http://veloblingbling.ch

LED lights for bicycle wheels.
16 multi color LEDs on each side (PCB top- and bottom side).
There are two windows (upper and lower) on each side for display 
dynamic information like speed, trip time, trip distance, etc. or
static information like strings and images.
The windows have a resolution of 100 x 16 pixels.
The space between the windows can be filled with a pattern/image 
(AKA blingbling).

Target system is a proprietary PCB (eWheel32 V1.4 an newer) with a
MK22DX256VLF5 MCU from Freescale/NXP. The PCB is free hardware, see 
https://github.com/spyren/veloblingbling-pcb

There is also optional Bluetooth Low Energy (Smart) subsystem on board. 
It is a LAIRD BL600 module. The application software is also on GitHub:

It is possible to mount die PCB direct onto the wheel spokes but it is 
better to use a mounting frame. This frame can be ordered from
http://shapeways.com or you can print it by yourself on 3D printer.
